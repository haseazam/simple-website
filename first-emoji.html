    <h1>First Uses of Emoji</h1>
<p>An Emoji is essentially a symbol that is used for communication, in its plainest terms. 
    Since the beginning of humanity, symbols have been used to communicate meanings, form languages,etc.
    For example, the cross is often used to identify being a Christian, and would be instantly recognizable especially in medieval times.

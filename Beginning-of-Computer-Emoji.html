    <h1>ASCII</h1>
<p>ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange), one of the first coding standards, wrote their own emoticons in 1982, specifically by Scott Fahlman.
    The idea was to distinguish serious code from silly code through smiling and frowning faces. These symbols caught on and became widely known during this era.

<h2>Kaomoji</h2>
<p>
    Around the same time as ASCII was developing their emoticons, many users in Japan began developing another type of emoticon called Kaomoji. 
    This kind of emoticon used more along the lines of faces instead of simple text, and this, alongside the ASCII emoticons, became widespread and the norm, and are still used many times to this day
